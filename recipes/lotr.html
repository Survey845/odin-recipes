        <h1>Elven Lembas - Bread</h1>
        <img src="bread.jpg" alt="Lembas, also known as Elven bread or waybread (in the Common Speech), was a special and closely guarded secret of the Elves.">
        <p>Eat little at a time, and only at need. For these things are given to serve you when all else fails. The cakes will keep sweet for many many days, if they are unbroken and left in their leaf-wrappings, as we have brought them. One will keep a traveler on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be one of the tall men of Minas Tirith.</p>
        <p>While this recipe won’t satiate your appetite with a single bite, it will serve as a delightful treat perfect for afternoon tea….or any of the other 6 hobbit meals throughout the day (including breakfast, second breakfast, elevenses, luncheon, dinner, and/or supper). Resembling a scone, this recipe produces bread that is light in taste and satisfying in texture. Bake these up to celebrate Hobbit Day, to serve at your next Lord of the Rings party, or to enjoy during your next marathon (book or movies).</p>
