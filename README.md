# Odin-Recipes

## This repository is my attempt at learning front-end development from the ground up, taking guidance from hands-on resourses, specifically, The Odin Project.
## This repo only contains files using HTML, at least till date. It will be updated as and when I polish my CSS, Javascript and other frameworks like Node and React.
